# Intro

I(Shubham) am a Computer Science graduate, serving as a software developer.Apart from academics,I love combining leadership and business strategies to crack growth-oriented oppurtunities with professionals.

My career has been a gumbo mix of technology and business hybrid. I spend my time across different areas of interest to explore all possible ideas and opportunities.I am a Investor, a tech-Enthusiast, a keen reader, a passionate photographer. Specific topics like Artificial Intelligence,Human Consciousness, venture-startup, financial markets draw my attention immensely. Even organizations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc fill my cup of intrest for their innovative flavours in technology.

# Some history

- In 2016, my uncle gifted me an old Tandy laptop when I was 16. It had an AMD processor and 4GB of RAM. My favorite games on it were Grand Theft Auto, Turbo C++ (for obvious reasons), and Tom and Jerry. The laptop had a rough keyboard and a bulky, heating body. To this day, I still wonder if an iron would have performed better..
- Until 2018, C++ was the only programming language I had encountered, and printing star patterns in C++ was a nightmare.
- During the next two years of my Computer Science course, I volunteered for event managers to earn pocket money. This experience exposed me to various tech tools and applications, including Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and elegant websites. Observing these technologies at corporate events significantly inspired and advanced my programming journey.
- In my final year, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a nationwide lockdown, which I consider a turning point. With ample free time, I took online courses and learned programming from YouTube, transforming tasks like reversing a number from a challenge to a manageable task.
- In the latter half of my final year, I had the opportunity to build an online platform for ATKT examinations at my college, which aligned with my skillset. This project occupied the remainder of my final year.
- At 21, just before my convocation, I received my first job offer from Wipro Technologies.
- After graduating, I worked as a fresher developer at Brackets Infinity, where I gained experience with modern JavaScript frameworks.
- 2021 is considered one of the best years of my life to date.
- At 22, I began studying Data Structures and Algorithms, machine learning concepts, and developed simple ML models using resources from YouTube. Although I received an interview call from Google due to my early exposure, I was unfortunately rejected in the first round.
- At 23, I embarked on my financial journey, exploring F&O Trading and the Crypto Boom, which captured my attention.
- At 24 (present), I am focused on core programming, LeetCode, and long-term investments and SIPs.
